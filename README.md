In image steganographic methods, it is required to effectively hide the secret message, so areas which are less sensitive to the human visual system must be identified. Wavelet transform is able to identify these areas in the cover image through frequency bands decomposition which include information of sharp transitions, edges and texture. Additionally, Deep learning offers a powerful approach to steganography by training deep neural networks to embed secret data into images imperceptibly. These networks can modify pixel values in a subtle manner that remains visually indistinguishable to the human eye, and can also be trained to extract hidden information from images.
